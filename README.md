## 🚀 RAG AI Customized Widget

### 🌟 Overview
I have developed a **RAG AI Customized Widget** that can scrape **any website**, no matter how complex, and allow users to **chat** with the extracted content using an interactive widget. This project leverages the power of **FastAPI** for the backend and **React (Vite)** for the frontend to deliver a seamless and efficient experience.

### 🔧 Technologies Used
- **FastAPI** 🚀 - High-performance, easy-to-use web framework for the backend
- **React (Vite)** ⚛️ - Fast and modern frontend framework
- **Scraping Engine** 🕷️ - Handles dynamic and complex websites
- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) AI** 🤖 - Enhances chatbot responses with real-time, scraped data

### 🎯 Features
- **🔍 Scrape any website**, regardless of complexity
- **💬 Chat with extracted content** through an AI-powered widget
- **⚡ FastAPI backend** ensures rapid processing
- **🖥️ React (Vite) frontend** for a smooth user experience
- **📊 Optimized retrieval and response generation**

### 📌 How It Works
1. Enter the URL of the website you want to scrape.
2. The system scrapes the website and processes the content.
3. Start chatting with the widget, which retrieves relevant information using RAG AI.

### 📂 Setup & Installation
